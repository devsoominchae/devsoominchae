# Greetings!
I continue to find answers to unsolved problems and develop problem solving skills.
I am currently working on person re-identification project

```python
class developer(SWEngineer):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = 'Chae, Soo Min'
        self.interests = ['AI(Computer Vision)', 'Running']
        self.language = 'Python'
        self.framework = 'PyTorch'
        self.colab = ['Notion', 'Github']
```
